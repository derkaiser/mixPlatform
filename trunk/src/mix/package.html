Coordinates the components of this mix. Each component (offering methods) 
has its own (architecture) interface (see package <code>architectureInterfaces
</code>) and a controller class (named <code>"ComponentName"Controller</code>),
implementing the according interface.
Therefore, the implementation of each component can change, without changes to 
any other component (interface and implementing (controller) class remain the 
same).
<p>
General information: A mix is some kind of proxy that attempts to hide the 
correspondence between its incoming and outgoing messages, as proposed by David 
Chaum in 1981. 
<p>
This mix implements the following functions (and others):
<ul>
<li> collecting messages (batch strategy with timeout)
<li> recoding messages (hybrid cryptography)
<li> sorting messages (recursive divide and conquer)
<li> detecting replays (based on timestamps and hash tables, constant time)
<li> validating integrity (using MACs)
<li> padding messages
<li> channels
<li> duplex communication
<li> clock synchronization (SNTP)
<li> dynamic reply length (depending on traffic situation)
<li> generating log files
<li> exchange of certain types of information with communication partners
<li> parallel message processing (e. g. recoding)
<li> non-blocking I/O between clients and mix
<li> multiplexing between mixes
</ul>
<p>
A test environment is found in the package <code>testEnvironment</code>.
