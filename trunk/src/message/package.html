Provides different message formats, the <code>InputOutputHandler</code> is 
capable of transmitting. Generally, there are two types of messages: 
<code>ExternalMessage</code>s and <code>InternalMessage</code>s. External 
messages involve a communication partner, that is no mix (e. g. a client or 
server). In contrast, internal messages are only sent between the mixes of a 
cascade (e. g. to transmit control information between two components located 
on different mixes). Both types can be <code>Request</code>s or 
<code>Reply</code>ies. Requests travel through the cascade from left to right 
(where "left" is the cascade's first mix, handling connections from clients 
and "right" is the cascade's last mix).
<p>
All messages extend the abstract class <code>Message</code>. The following 
messages are present:
<ul>
<li> <code>ChannelEstablishMessage</code> (<code>ExternalMessage</code>, <code>
Request</code>): Used to establish a channel, which can transmit <code>
ChannelMessage</code>s and <code>Reply</code>ies.
<li> <code>ChannelMessage</code> (<code>ExternalMessage</code>, <code>
Request</code>): Used to transmit data on an existing channel.
<li> <code>ChannelReleaseMessage</code> (<code>ExternalMessage</code>, <code>
Request</code>): Used to release an existing channel.
<li> <code>ReplyMessage</code> (<code>ExternalMessage</code>, <code>
Reply</code>): Used to send data from right to left on an existing channel.
<li> <code>BatchSizeMessage</code> (<code>InternalMessage</code>, <code>
Request</code>): Used for communication between <code>OutputStrategy</code> 
components, located on different mixes (for batch synchronization).
</ul>
<p>
Messages which consist of more than two message parts (<code>
ChannelEstablishMessage</code> and <code>ChannelMessage</code>) each have an 
exclusive enumeration (<code>ChannelEstablishMessagePart</code> and <code>
ChannelMessagePart</code>) defining these parts.
<p>
The length of some message parts varies depending on the current mix' 
position in the cascade (Note: Message length isn't constant in a cascade). 
To avert the need of defining different message parts (of the same type) for 
each mix, "dynamic" message parts are supported. They calculate their length 
and position automatically (according to the current mix' position in the 
cascade and the fixed position and length of the current part on the last mix
of the cascade (which must be specified anyways, just like with non-dynamic 
message parts)).
<p>
An automatic padding mechanism is included, using the padding mechanism of 
component <code>MessageProcessor</code>.
