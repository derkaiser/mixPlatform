The Client used to anonymize data (e. g. from a user's application) via a 
cascade of mixes. "Client" is the name of this package's main class as well. It 
follows the "everything is a stream" concept. See 
<code>architectureInterfaces.ClientInterface</code>. From a user perspective, 
the <code>Client</code> behaves quite equal to a socket (<code>java.net.Socket
</code>) and therefore abstracts from the underlying technique.
