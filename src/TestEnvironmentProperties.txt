# The following properties have the following form: "KEY=VALUE".
# Note: Changing a KEY will result in runtime errors.

#
# NUMBER_OF_MIXES_IN_CASCADE
# The number of mixes to be simulated.
# Default value: 3
NUMBER_OF_MIXES_IN_CASCADE = 3
#
#
# START_PORT_OF_PORT_RANGE
# Port, the first mix of the cascade (specified above) shall have. The 
# following mixes will respectively use the next higher port of their 
# predecessor.
# Default value: 23301
START_PORT_OF_PORT_RANGE = 23301
#
#
# INFO_START_PORT_OF_PORT_RANGE
# Port, the cascade's first mix' "ExternalInformationPort" shall be accessible 
# on. The following mixes will respectively use the next higher port of their 
# predecessor.
# Default value: 23351
INFO_START_PORT_OF_PORT_RANGE = 23351
#
#
# X, Y, Z
# Start "logic" for the simulated clients:
# "Start X clients every Y ms until Z clients are started!"
# Note:	- Use "RANDOM-UpperBound" (e. g. "RANDOM-1000") for random values 
#		  between 0 (inclusive) and "UpperBound" (inclusive).
#		- A random value is chosen any time its variable (e. g. "X") is used
#		  (Therefore, "X" will have a different random value for any client "Z" 
#		  in the previous example).
#		- Starting many clients at the same time will cause heavy CPU-load on 
# 		  mixes and ClientSimulator since ChannelEstablishMessages use 
#		  asymmetric cryptography (Therefore, a mix can hold much more 
#		  connections than it can accept at once).
X = 3
Y = 1000
Z = 6
#
#
# K, L, M
# The simulated clients will behave in the following manner:
# "Send K bytes of data with a delay of L ms between sending, M times."
# Note:	- Use "RANDOM-UpperBound" (e. g. "RANDOM-1000") for random values 
#		  between 0 (inclusive) and "UpperBound" (inclusive).
#		- A random value is chosen any time its variable (e. g. "L") is used
#		  (Therefore, "K" will have a different random value for any send
#		  event "M" in the previous example).
K = 5000
L = 1000
M = 2
